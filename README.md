Title: RomCom - Not All Pairs Mate for Life
---

## My Learning Goals Remain

([x]) * Write clean, DRY JavaScript for the variables          needed.    
*I would like to learn how to make it more dynamic and DRY with less variables.*
([x]) Use a provided class by creating object instances using the `new` keyword.  
([x]) Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM

## Overview

Romance Novels are addictive by nature.  It almost doesn't matter what is in them as long as the reader goes through the characters' experience of rise to passion and intrigue.  

I have created an app that allows the user to get curious about the variety and randomness of the covers, titles and story tag-lines of the romance novels I had access to.

My hope for the user is that the visual encounter of the covers, titles and taglines of the romance novels will be stimulating in its own way.

## Contributors
Angela M. Battillo wrote the javaScript code for this project, with the coaching of Jahara Clark (her SLC rep) and Kristen Bair (her rock).

## Functionality Goal
* I wanted to make it possible for someone to open my link and be able to either click to view random and inclusive romance novel covers or reload the page and view random romance novel covers.  I wanted the buttons to add to the functionality of the page and help guide the user through a visual experience.

## Future Iterations Goals
* I will want to see the user to fill out a form and create their own unique romance novel cover.
* I want to see all the information entered saved and able to review
* I want to make it possible for the user to change their mind about a cover they saved and delete it.
* Then I'd like to impliment error handling, drag and drop functionality and a sharpening of the functionality of viewing the covers when clicked.

## The Bones
1. javaScript code is written to manipulate the DOM
2. HTML, CSS, and some javaScript data are given to complete the project
3. Terminal, GIT, Atom and Chrome Browser are used to write, save, and test the app
4. To access the page click this link here:
[Rom Com](https://battan40.github.io/romcom/
)
5. To test the app's functionality, navigate to page at above link. Then click buttons and check pages bugs.
6. Quick Link to the romcom build out instructions are here:
